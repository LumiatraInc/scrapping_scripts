Our goal is to educate and inspire people to change their buying habits to equally effective but more sustainable products that showcase the power of nature whilst allowing them to feel good about their choices.\n\nLess than 50% of products used in the bathroom are recycled compared to 90% in the kitchen. This is combined with growing mistrust of the impact traditional products and their chemical makeup have on our body and the environment. Currently, to change your daily habits you have to sacrifice either the efficacy, convenience or experience of your products. At Wild we want to create a range of high performing natural products that are 100% sustainable but also provide a frictionless experience so customers can switch without compromise. No refill stations, no rubbing creams under your armpits, no complicated recycling instructions. Just simple high quality natural products you can trust."},

This is a much more natural way of working with dogs and helps you to communicate with your pet on a level that they understand. "},

On the chest it allows for better and easier control. A lead attached to the back encourages dogs to pull.\nThe harness enables the dog plenty of freedom and comfort, and trains them to walk to heal. \nIt also helps the dog walker control the dog and alleviates all the aches and strains, bad backs and shoulder problems from a pulling dog.

Let me tell you the tail (pun intended) of how our brand came to be.\n\nIt all started 3 years ago when my furry best friend Dudley had a bad reaction to a bag of shop bought treats from a well-known supermarket chain. Little did we know that the treats were chock-full of hidden nasties such as cereals, corn, sugar, derivatives, preservatives, and flavourings. It didn't take long for Dudley to develop a runny bum and a bad tummy - talk about a total paw-saster!\n\nWe rushed Dudley to our local vet who ran a few tests and discovered that he was allergic to wheat. After a lot of research, countless emails, and car miles, we finally stumbled upon a handful of fantastic natural treat suppliers who we now partner with to bring you the best of the best natural dog treats today.\n\nBut we didn't stop there. We realised that there were so many dog owners out there who were also struggling to find healthy, safe and delicious treats for their fur babies. That's when we decided to create a community of like-minded dog owners who share our passion for all things natural, nutritious and delicious.\n\nSo, we started a private customer Facebook group where dog owners could come together, interact, and share their stories, tips, and tricks. We wanted to create a space where people could feel supported, educated and empowered to make the best choices for their dogs.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we did! Our community has grown into a tight-knit group of dog moms and dads who are passionate about giving their furry family members the very best. We've become a go-to resource for dog owners looking to go raw hide-free, learn more about the benefits of natural dog treats, and connect with other dog lovers who share their values.\n\nSo, whether you're a seasoned dog mom/dad or a brand new puppy parent, we're here for you. We're excited to be a part of your dog's journey and can't wait to see what the future holds. Thanks for being a part of our pack! üê∂üíõ"},

{"business_name": "Ruroc", "total_reviews": "13,538", "ratings": "4.2", "total_ratings": 5, "about": "In the beginning, Ruroc founders launched the world's first full-face snow-sports helmet. Today it is the globally renowned RG1-DX. Known for its signature aesthetic, extreme safety, and detachable faceguard. The full-face RG1-DX was designed to protect against sub-zero temperatures, tree-line branches, back-country rocks and park rails.\n\nThe RG1-DX is no longer the only available helmet on the Ruroc roster. On February 27th 2019, Ruroc dropped the ATLAS motorcycle helmet on the world. The ATLAS helmet quickly gained popularity in the world of moto, with its instantly recognisable style and the lightweight solidity of carbon-fibre. Exactly one year later, the ATLAS 2.0 propelled the brand to the next level of industry prominence. Having listened to customer feedback about the original ATLAS; we internally restructured the ATLAS 2.0 for improved comfort and sizing accuracy, reduced wind-noise, fitted a visor locking pin, designed a tool-less and more tactile visor and fitted a range of other awesome features.\n\nIn the middle of 2020, Ruroc introduced the BERSERKER streetfighter style motorcycle helmet. Off-road styling met street performance with an aggressive and aero-dynamic safety-certified carbon-fibre shell. The BERSERKER helmet has grown popular for its non-conventional and non-conforming style. Built primarily for on-road ripping, riders all over the world have worn it for a range of EPIC purposes - including snowmobile riding, ATV use and off-road moto use.\n\nLess than three months later, Ruroc launched the LITE Ski/Snowboard range. An open-face, pro-performance helmet tried and tested by some of the world‚Äôs greatest snow athletes; including Max Parrot, Tanner Hall, LJ Strenio and more. One thing is certain, the LITE helmet is a light helmet that is heavy on high-tech features. Available with the newly developed Shockwave audio ear-padding, fitted with the industry-leading Fidlock buckle and rotational-impact technology built into the helmet‚Äôs EPS structure. Combined with the wide-viewing and fogless optics of the pro-performance LITE goggles, the LITE setup is a force to be reckoned with. "},

{"business_name": "Contractcars.com", "total_reviews": "4,342", "ratings": "4.9", "total_ratings": 5, "about": "The story of how we began is a simple one. We were looking for a lease car ourselves, so we started visiting a few of the local dealers in our area. It didn‚Äôt go so well. Each one we visited was so intent on selling the cars in their range, that they didn‚Äôt even ask what we really needed, let alone take any notice of it. They just tried to sell us all the bells and whistles, for the most money, and honestly, it turned us right off. No-one wants to be pushed into getting things they don‚Äôt need and we were no different.\n\nSo rather than just moaning about the experience, we decided to do something about it. Putting our money where our mouth is we created a service that cares about you and the cars you need. Instead of comparing just one of two dealers, we decided we could compare them all to give you the best selection possible to choose from. We know exactly what our customers want and need and we deliver every time. It‚Äôs this understanding that has made us the successful business we are today, because we put you first.\n\nWe built Contract Cars on a new ideal ‚Äì price first. You tell us your budget, we find the best car for your money and your needs. So if you can get a Mercedes lease for the price of a Mondeo ‚Äì why not? There‚Äôs no hidden extras, just our down to earth transparent approach. We are Contract Cars and we are here to help."},

So much so, the legendary All Blacks rugby team approached them to produce rugby attire in which they could play.\n\nThe rest as they say is history; Canterbury of New Zealand outfitted the All Blacks team for over 75 years and is now the largest dedicated rugby brand in the world.  Canterbury currently supplies kit to numerous high-profile national rugby teams; England Rugby and Ireland Rugby, as well as leading clubs such as Bath and Ospreys.  \n\nThe brand has its roots firmly in the southern hemisphere with its spiritual home in New Zealand.

It launched in the UK and Europe in 2018 before further expansion into North America in 2020 and Australasia in 2021. \nThe award-winning Heatrub Ultimate baselayer was unveiled to the Japanese public in 2011 and since then hundreds of thousands of outdoor enthusiasts have discovered the benefits of that best-in-class product. Independently tested and proven to be five times warmer than a standard baselayer, the Heatrub Ultimate has become a must-have item in the coldest months of the year and, such was the popularity of the baselayer, Zerofit now offer leggings and socks made from the same material.\nOther key products include the Heatrub Move baselayer, which features Adaptable Warmth Technology, keeping you warm while at a standstill but also temperature regulation when you‚Äôre working up a sweat. For the summer months, the Cold Skin baselayer is three times colder than a competitor product, while the Ice Weave is the master when it comes to wicking excess sweat in the hottest conditions.\nFollowing exponential growth across industries including motorcycling, angling, running, hiking, sailing, golf, gardening, birdwatching and equestrian sports, Zerofit welcomed a new shareholder and ambassador in February 2023 - Brian O'Driscoll, the former Leinster, Ireland and British & Irish Lions rugby captain in order to help further enhance the business across multiple categories. And since November 2023, Bennetts British Superbikes Runner-Up Glenn Irwin has joined the brand as an ambassador. He will rely on Zerofit baselayers while racing during the 2024 season. \nThe European HQ of Zerofit is in County Antrim, Northern Ireland, with further offices in Adelaide, Australia and San Diego in the US. Specialist customer service teams in each country ensure prompt and accurate delivery of products as the brand continues to grow globally.\nWhatever your sport or activity, we hope Zerofit will become your baselayer brand of choice. \n"},

The lighting is a mix of chandeliers and soft spotlights invoking a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining.\n\nThere are two levels of dining at Ardec and an open kitchen where all our dishes will be freshly cooked.
